- P50, P90, P95 percentiles
- Breakdown by component/team

Improvement Strategies:
- Reduce code review time
- Automate testing and validation
- Streamline deployment pipeline
- Remove manual approval gates where safe
```

**Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR):**
```
Calculation: Total downtime / Number of incidents
Target: <1 hour (elite performers)

Tracking:
- Incident detection time
- Diagnosis time
- Fix deployment time
- Validation time

Improvement Strategies:
- Improve monitoring and alerting

```

### Technical Debt Prioritization Matrix

```
Impact vs. Effort Matrix:

High Impact,       High Impact,
Low Effort         High Effort
(DO FIRST)         (PLAN & EXECUTE)
    │                  │
────┼──────────────────┼────
    │                  │
Low Impact,        Low Impact,
Low Effort         High Effort
(FILL TIME)        (AVOID)

Prioritization Formula:
Priority Score = (Business Impact × Velocity Impact) / Effort

Where:
- Business Impact: 1-10 (risk, customer impact, revenue)
- Velocity Impact: 1-10 (how much it slows development)
- Effort: 1-10 (time and complexity to fix)

Examples:
- Security vulnerability: (10 × 8) / 3 = 26.7 (CRITICAL)
- Slow build times: (6 × 9) / 5 = 10.8 (HIGH)
- Code style cleanup: (2 × 3) / 2 = 3.0 (LOW)
```

### Team Scaling Guidelines

**Optimal Team Size:**
- Minimum viable team: 3-5 engineers (sufficient for sustainable delivery)
- Ideal team size: 5-9 engineers (two-pizza rule, Bezos principle)
- Maximum before split: 10-12 engineers (communication overhead increases)

**Team Composition:**
```
Balanced Team Example (8 engineers):
- 1 Staff/Principal Engineer (tech lead, 15-20% code)
- 2 Senior Engineers (architecture, mentorship, 60-70% code)
- 3 Mid-level Engineers (feature development, 80-90% code)
- 2 Junior Engineers (learning, support work, 90-95% code)

Responsibilities Distribution:
- Architecture & Design: 20% of total capacity
- Feature Development: 50% of total capacity
- Technical Debt: 15% of total capacity
- On-call & Support: 10% of total capacity
- Learning & Development: 5% of total capacity
```

**Manager Span of Control:**
```
Engineering Manager:
- Direct reports: 6-10 engineers (ideal: 8)
- Indirect reports: 0 (individual contributors only)
- Meeting time: ~50% (1:1s, planning, hiring, reviews)
- Coding time: 0-10% (mostly reviewing, pairing, troubleshooting)

Senior Engineering Manager:
- Direct reports: 3-5 managers
- Indirect reports: 20-40 engineers
- Meeting time: ~60% (manager coaching, strategic planning)
- Coding time: 0% (hands-off, focus on leadership)

Director of Engineering:
- Direct reports: 3-6 managers
- Indirect reports: 40-80 engineers
- Meeting time: ~70% (executive alignment, strategic planning)
- Technical involvement: Architecture reviews, technical strategy
```

### Monolith to Microservices Migration

**Context:** E-commerce platform, 5-year-old Rails monolith, scaling challenges

**Decision Point:** Migrate to microservices vs. optimize monolith

**ADR: Gradual Microservices Extraction**

```markdown
# ADR-001: Adopt Strangler Fig Pattern for Microservices Migration

## Status
Accepted (2025-01-15)

## Context
Our Rails monolith (200K LOC) is experiencing:
- Slow deployment cycles (2 weeks per release)
- Scalability bottlenecks (payments, search)
- Team coordination overhead (15 engineers touching same code)
- Database performance issues (single PostgreSQL instance)
- Recruiting challenges (monolith expertise required)

## Decision Drivers
- Must maintain system stability during migration
- Need to scale payments and search independently
- Want to enable team autonomy
- Cannot afford big-bang rewrite (failed in 2022)
- Must deliver new features during migration

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Optimize Existing Monolith
Pros:
- Lowest risk and effort
- Familiar technology
- No architectural complexity
Cons:
- Doesn't solve scaling issues
- Team coordination still difficult
- Technical debt remains high
Cost: $200K (6 months optimization)
Risk: Medium (temporary fix only)

### Option 2: Complete Rewrite to Microservices
Pros:
- Clean slate, modern architecture
- Optimal service boundaries
- Latest technology choices
Cons:
- 18-24 month project
- Business feature freeze
- High risk of failure
- Previous attempt failed
Cost: $3M (18 months, opportunity cost)
Risk: High (historical precedent)

### Option 3: Gradual Extraction (Strangler Fig)
Pros:
- Progressive risk mitigation
- Continue feature delivery
- Learn and adapt approach
- Team skill development over time
Cons:
- Dual system complexity
- 12-18 month journey
- Requires discipline and coordination
Cost: $1.2M (18 months, absorbed into roadmap)
Risk: Medium (managed incrementally)

## Decision
We will adopt Option 3: Gradual extraction using Strangler Fig pattern.

**Approach:**
- Extract services one at a time over 18 months
- Start with payments (highest value, clear boundary)
- Continue with search, recommendations, inventory
- Maintain monolith for core e-commerce logic initially
- Use API gateway for routing
- Share database initially, extract later

**Service Extraction Order:**
1. Payments Service (Months 1-4)
2. Search Service (Months 5-8)
3. Recommendations Service (Months 9-11)
4. Inventory Service (Months 12-15)
5. User Management (Months 16-18)

**Technology Choices:**
- Language: Node.js (team has experience, good for I/O)
- Communication: REST + message queue (RabbitMQ)
- Database: PostgreSQL per service (familiar, reliable)
- Infrastructure: Kubernetes on AWS EKS
- Observability: DataDog for monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- Can scale payment processing independently (10x capacity)
- Teams can deploy services independently (daily deploys)
- Reduced coordination overhead (autonomous teams)
- Can recruit for specific service expertise
- Learn microservices gradually (skill building)
- Continue feature delivery during migration

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity (8 services vs 1 monolith)
- Need to build platform capabilities (service mesh, observability)
- Distributed system challenges (debugging, testing)
- Data consistency becomes more complex
- Higher infrastructure costs (+$40K/month)
- Team needs to learn new patterns and practices

### Mitigation Strategies
- Invest in platform team (4 engineers) for shared capabilities
- Comprehensive observability from day one
- Document patterns and best practices
- Regular architecture reviews and retrospectives
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Keep monolith deployment working throughout

## Follow-up

## Best Practices

### Technical Debt Management

**Do:**
- Track debt ratio as a key metric (target: <15%)
- Allocate dedicated capacity for debt reduction (15-25%)
- Prioritize debt by business impact, not just technical severity
- Make debt visible on roadmaps and sprint planning
- Celebrate debt reduction wins
- Prevent new debt through code review and standards
- Use "boy scout rule" (leave code better than you found it)
- Create clear definition of "critical" vs "nice-to-have" debt

**Don't:**
- Ignore debt until it becomes crisis
- Expect teams to "find time" for debt (must be planned)
- Prioritize only new features (creates debt spiral)
- Allow debt to accumulate without tracking
- Skip prevention in favor of remediation
- Make debt reduction a separate project (integrate into regular work)
- Blame individuals for debt (often systemic issues)
- Sacrifice quality for speed consistently

### Engineering Team Scaling

**Do:**
- Hire ahead of need (2-3 month lead time for recruiting)
- Maintain healthy ratios (manager:engineer, senior:junior)
- Invest heavily in onboarding (first 30-60-90 days plan)
- Build diverse teams (experience, background, perspective)
- Create clear career paths before scaling
- Establish processes before they're urgently needed
- Promote from within when possible (retention and motivation)
- Measure team health, not just output

**Don't:**
- Panic hire to meet deadlines (quality over speed)
- Only hire senior engineers (unsustainable and expensive)
- Neglect manager development (managers are force multipliers)
- Assume people will figure out culture (must be intentional)
- Scale without infrastructure (tools, processes, systems)
- Copy another company's structure (context matters)
- Under-invest in recruiting (top 10% of CTO time)
- Ignore retention metrics (hiring is expensive)

### Architecture Decision Making

**Do:**
- Document all significant decisions (ADRs)
- Consider at least 3 options
- Include team in decision process (ownership)
- Evaluate total cost of ownership, not just upfront cost
- Consider team capability and learning curve
- Plan for future evolution and flexibility
- Set clear success criteria
- Review decisions quarterly (learn and adapt)

**Don't:**
- Make decisions in isolation (ivory tower architecture)
- Follow hype without evaluation (resume-driven development)
- Optimize prematurely (YAGNI - You Ain't Gonna Need It)
- Ignore operational complexity
- Lock into vendors without exit strategy
- Make irreversible decisions lightly
- Skip proof of concept for major changes
- Fail to communicate decisions and rationale

### Technology Vendor Selection

**Do:**
- Start with clear requirements (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- Evaluate at least 3 vendors
- Run proof of concept with real use cases
- Check references (speak to 3+ customers)
- Read contracts carefully (data ownership, exit clauses)
- Calculate 3-year TCO (total cost of ownership)
- Assess vendor viability (financial health, roadmap)
- Plan for migration/exit from day one

**Don't:**
- Choose based on sales pitch alone
- Ignore hidden costs (integration, training, support)
- Select cheapest option without quality consideration
- Skip security and compliance review
- Trust vendor roadmap without verification
- Lock into long contracts without trial period
- Assume vendor will customize for you
- Make decision without technical team input

### Engineering Metrics and Measurement

**Do:**
- Focus on outcomes, not outputs (impact over activity)
- Use metrics to improve, not to punish
- Measure leading indicators (predict issues early)
- Balance speed, quality, and sustainability
- Make metrics visible and transparent
- Review metrics regularly (weekly dashboards)
- Adjust metrics as organization evolves
- Correlate metrics with business outcomes

**Don't:**
- Optimize for single metric (Goodhart's Law)
- Use metrics for performance reviews directly
- Track too many metrics (analysis paralysis)
- Ignore context and nuance (numbers don't tell full story)
- Compare teams unfairly (different contexts)
- Set metrics without team input (lack of ownership)
- Fail to act on metric insights
- Use vanity metrics (look good but meaningless)
